    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided</li>
      <li>1.75 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar,
        water, garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade over
        top. Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated.
        Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day (refrigerated),
        turning the chicken occasionally as it marinates.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil in
        a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken, discarding
        the remaining used marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked
        through and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating of
        glaze on the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5
        minutes before slicing and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
